# EdTech Recorded Lecture Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data for an EdTech startup aiming to expand its offerings in recorded lectures. Using Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard 
to uncover insights about course categories, viewer engagement, skill relevance, and language preferences. These insights empower the startup to optimize their recorded 
lecture services and align offerings with market demand.

## Problem Statement 
The EdTech startup has collected data from various online platforms but needs expert analysis to make informed decisions about its recorded lecture services. The goal is to:

1. Identify trends and patterns in course types and viewer engagement.
2. Understand audience preferences based on categories, subcategories, skills, and languages.
3. Highlight high-performing instructors and optimize course duration for better viewer engagement.
4. By addressing these objectives, the startup can strategically enhance its recorded lecture offerings and maximize its market impact.

## Solution Approach
To address the problem, the following steps were implemented:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

--Removed inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates from the dataset.
--Standardized columns for categories, subcategories, languages, and instructors.

2. Dashboard Development in Power BI

--Category Analysis: Explored course type distribution across categories to identify high-demand areas.
--Engagement Insights: Calculated average views for each category, subcategory, and language to reveal viewer preferences.
--Skill Relevance: Identified commonly taught skills to ensure alignment with job market demands.
--Language Preferences: Analyzed language distribution and preferences across the top 5 categories based on user demand.
--Subtitles and Accessibility: Examined the impact of subtitle availability on viewer engagement.
--Instructor Performance: Ranked the top 3 instructors per category and subcategory based on ratings.
--Course Duration Analysis: Investigated the relationship between course duration and views to determine optimal length preferences.

3. Key Insights

--Highlighted high-demand course types and the most engaging content strategies.
--Provided actionable recommendations for content development and instructor collaboration.
